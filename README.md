# Data Cleaning and Analysis Using SQL

## Introduction
Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis pipeline. This project demonstrates the process of cleaning a global layoffs dataset using SQL. The dataset includes information on layoffs by companies across the globe, covering attributes like company name, location, industry, total layoffs, and dates. The aim of the project is to transform the raw data into a clean, reliable, and usable dataset, ready for exploratory data analysis and insights generation.

## Methodology
This project involved four key steps:

1. **Removing Duplicate Rows**  
   Duplicates were identified and removed to ensure data integrity. Special care was taken to preserve valid records of layoffs occurring on different dates or in different locations.

2. **Standardization of Data**  
   Text-based columns were standardized by trimming unnecessary spaces, correcting misspellings, and normalizing inconsistent entries (e.g., location names like "Dusseldorf" and "Düsseldorf"). Numeric fields, such as percentages, were also adjusted for consistency and readability.

3. **Handling Missing Values**  
   Missing values were addressed through a combination of imputation (e.g., assigning industries based on company name) and exclusion where imputation was impractical. For instance, records with both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` missing were removed.

4. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**  
   Columns irrelevant to the analysis, such as those used for intermediate processing, were dropped to streamline the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
After cleaning the data, exploratory queries were conducted to derive insights:

- **Timeframe Covered:**  
  The dataset spans from March 2020 to March 2023, highlighting layoffs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Key Statistics:**  
  - Total layoffs: 383,659  
  - Total funds raised: $1.601 billion  

- **Layoff Trends Over Time:**  
  Layoffs peaked in January 2023 with 84,714 layoffs, followed by significant layoffs in November 2022 and February 2023.

- **Industries Affected:**  
  The Consumer and Retail industries experienced the highest layoffs, with 44,782 and 43,613 respectively. Manufacturing was the least affected.

- **Countries Affected:**  
  The USA and India recorded the highest layoffs, reflecting their large populations and workforce sizes.

- **Company Rankings:**  
  Amazon, Google, and Meta were among the companies with the largest layoffs.

## Major Insights
- **COVID-19 Impact:**  
  The pandemic significantly affected layoffs, especially in industries like Consumer, Retail, and Technology.

- **Regional Disparities:**  
  Layoffs were concentrated in specific countries, highlighting regional economic and business trends.

- **Economic Challenges:**  
  High layoff numbers in late 2022 and early 2023 point to broader economic challenges beyond the pandemic.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project highlights several skills critical to a data analyst's role:
- **SQL Proficiency:**  
  Leveraging advanced SQL features like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Aggregations for data transformation and analysis.
  
- **Data Cleaning Expertise:**  
  Handling duplicates, standardizing data, correcting typos, and imputing missing values effectively.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Deriving meaningful insights through structured queries and ranking mechanisms.

- **Problem-Solving:**  
  Addressing inconsistencies in raw data and ensuring data quality for analysis.

- **Attention to Detail:**  
  Carefully validating changes and maintaining data integrity throughout the process.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning as a foundation for reliable analysis. By transforming messy, inconsistent data into a structured and accurate dataset, actionable insights were derived about global layoffs. The process showcases essential skills required for data analytics, making it an excellent portfolio project for aspiring data analysts. This project also highlights how clean data can empower decision-making in areas like workforce management, economic planning, and organizational strategy.

# Data Cleaning and Analysis Using SQL

## Introduction
Data cleaning is one of the most crucial steps in preparing data for meaningful analysis. This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of global layoffs using SQL, with the goal of transforming raw, messy data into a clean and reliable dataset. The dataset includes information such as company names, locations, industries, and layoff numbers. By cleaning this data, we can ensure accuracy and consistency, making it ready for analysis and insights.

## Methodology
The project followed a systematic approach to data cleaning, broken down into four key steps:

1. **Removing Duplicates**  
   Duplicate rows were identified and removed to maintain the integrity of the dataset. Care was taken to retain valid entries where layoffs occurred in different locations or on different dates.

2. **Standardizing Data**  
   Text fields were cleaned by trimming excess spaces, correcting typos, and normalizing inconsistent entries, such as variations in location names. Numeric fields were formatted for consistency, making the dataset easier to interpret.

3. **Handling Missing Values**  
   Missing data was addressed by either imputing values (e.g., assigning industries based on company names) or removing rows where imputation was not feasible. For instance, rows with both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` missing were excluded.

4. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**  
   Columns used only for intermediate steps, such as row numbering, were removed to streamline the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
After the dataset was cleaned, several exploratory queries were performed to uncover insights:

- **Timeframe Covered:**  
  The dataset spans from March 2020 to March 2023, capturing layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

- **Key Metrics:**  
  - Total layoffs: 383,659  
  - Total funds raised: $1.601 billion  

- **Trends Over Time:**  
  Layoffs peaked in January 2023, with 84,714 layoffs. Other significant periods included November 2022 and February 2023.

- **Industries Affected:**  
  Consumer and Retail industries experienced the highest layoffs, with 44,782 and 43,613 layoffs, respectively. Manufacturing was the least impacted sector.

- **Regional Impact:**  
  The USA and India recorded the highest layoffs, which aligns with their large populations and workforce sizes.

- **Top Companies by Layoffs:**  
  Amazon, Google, and Meta were among the companies with the highest total layoffs.

## Major Insights

  Layoffs surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, heavily affecting industries like Consumer, Retail, and Technology.

- **Regional Patterns:**  
  The data shows layoffs were concentrated in specific countries, reflecting broader economic and business trends.

- **Post-Pandemic Challenges:**  
  The increase in layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023 points to economic pressures extending beyond the pandemic.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates several critical skills for data analysts:
- **SQL Expertise:**  
  The use of advanced SQL features, including CTEs, window functions, and aggregations, to clean and analyze data effectively.
